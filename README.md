# Parallel-Histogram-Equalization

Histogram equalization is a technique for adjusting image intensities to enhance contrast in input images, using MPI Parallel Programming

In gray images, each pixel has only one value which is the intensity of the pixels. The value may range from 0 to 255. The values vary from black at the weakness intensity to white at strongest
